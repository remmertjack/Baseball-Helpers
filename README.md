# Baseball-Helpers
Designed to help those in need for quick, yet powerful analysis either in plotting Aging Curves, Web-Scraping data, or classifying players.

Why does this exist? Well necessity is the mother of invention. Hence, Baseball Helpers. Essentially, I got tired of creating ad-hoc processes to solve a current problem and thus turned them into general processes or as general as possible processes. 

These "helper" functions are designed to be as flexable as possible. Please see each package's documentation for specific details.
