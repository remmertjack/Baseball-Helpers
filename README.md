# Baseball-Helpers
Designed to help those in need for quick, yet powerful analysis either in plotting Aging Curves, Web-Scraping data, or classifying players. Not designed for specific problems, but rather to help ease ad-hoc analysis and come up with initial ideas.

Why does this exist? Well necessity is the mother of invention. Hence, Baseball Helpers. Essentially, I got tired of creating ad-hoc processes to solve a current problem and thus turned them into general processes or as general as possible processes. 

These "helper" functions are designed to be as flexable as possible. Please see each package's documentation for specific details.

### List of packages used besides pandas and numpy
* scipy
* plotnine
* sklearn
* beautiful soup

### Table of Contents
* Aging Curves
* Functions (see below for list of functions)
* More things to come!

### Functions
This is a short list of functions I have created to help make data collection or any preprocessing easier. Some may need to be updated over time as they are rather ad-hoc at the time (change 2019 to 2020 in a webscraping script because of the target url).
* FanGraphs_ServiceTime
